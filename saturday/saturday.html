				<p>Had two little toys. Enjoy them with all the strength of a hastag brownie! :)</p>
				<p>Should PHP hypertext preprocessor complete alot of this work for me? Typing out this many page layouts is going to get killer after a while. Then after a while I will replace the hand written page layouts with a template that I can resave somewhere. How about a box on a page that you fill in and it creates the page for you using your input.</p>

				<h1>Can you please...</h1>
				<p>Show me how you like to move in a dance move. Should we homebrew the Nintendo DSi's? would the boys like them any more than they do right now?</p>
